Hi there!

I am Ozan, and I am a developer that buil(t&ds) value.

### Professional

I have worked in 3 different companies as an intern and a freelancer for a year, providing software that is used by many internally and externally to create more value on each step (learning, implement, testing, improving).

Places I worked for:
* Stylelounge:
  I have worked in a startup named Stylelounge in Germany, in which I was a part of a real startup environment, and I learned about many software development practices there. I had also had my first conference experience when I attended [code.talks](https://www.codetalks.de/) with some colleagues from Stylelounge.
* Gittigidiyor (eBay Turkey):
  I have been an intern in the largest e-commerce marketplace in Turkey. I was then allowed to create a project on my own, with some guidance from my seniors, and have successfully developed a web-app for internal uses.
* ESENSI (Sierra Nevada Corp. Turkey):
  I have had my first software engineering experience here, which made me realize how different the actual working environment is from the homework we had at the university. I have created a simulator with other interns using Java and OMG DDS compliant libraries, which was my first peek into enterprise integration and QoS policies for data transfer.

### Education
I have graduated from one of the best universities in Turkey (and leading in CS in Turkey, according to QS) with a high honors degree. During my academic career, I have improved myself by building software used by the organizations that I participated in. I am going to start my Master's Degree at Milan Polytechnic University in the upcoming days.


### Personal

I enjoy watching dev talks, create projects that never end, read books, (and stare to the ceiling from time to time :sweat_smile:). I play tennis whenever I find the opportunity to, ski in the winter and take a walk when I need some distraction.

More details about me available in [my CV](/cv).
