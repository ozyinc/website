**cGPA: 3.54**
 
I have graduated from METU CENG with a High Honor degree, and a ranking of 13 out of 207 students.
{{< cv/collapse title="Courses" >}}

I took many courses during my studies in METU CENG department from basic CS courses to Spanish and Psychology, and listing all here would be unnecessary. However, some highlights that made me a better developer are: 

{{< cv/collapse title="Introduction to Computer Engineering Concepts (CENG111)" >}}
   This introductory course was the first course among many that I took during my studies has introduced me to the fundamentals of computer science and engineering. During this course I have learned: 
   * fundamental functionality of a basic CPU, which was astonishing on how it reflects the general functionalities and issues regarding computer programming (mainly robustness and step-by-step execution of programs).
   * basics of recursion and iteration, and how to map one to other, considering the implications that this has for dynamic programming and many other algorithms I would personally consider this the best contribution.
   * basics of complexity analysis
   * Ubuntu, Linux and the GNU ecosystem
   * and Python :grinning:   

{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="C Programming (CENG140)" >}}
   As the second course about CENG that I took, this course has introduced me to the C language and it's low-level complex beauty. While learning how to write efficient code and managing dynamic memory, our instructor has also introduced us to how the memory in a computer is managed and what parts do programs have, answering many questions that I had while learning Python. Even though most of the topics were merely an introduction to the concepts and ideas of the programming languages and operating systems courses in the future, it has succeeded in creating an overall idea and appreciation of the hardships of the field that our predecessors has faced regarding basic optimization.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Logic Design (CENG232)" >}}
   I took this course in my first year, and it provided a better understanding of the actual implementation of various parts of the computer, starting with a few logic gates and adding clocks to provide sequential execution. With this course I have learned how specific mechanisms needed for a computer's functionality can be realized, and it also introduced me to FPGA programming using Verilog.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Data Structures (CENG213)" >}}
   This course, even if it has covered many basic data structures (like stacks, queues, linked list, trees, arrays, etc...), has a special place in my memory, due to its detailed insights on workings of hash tables. With this course I have obtained information that has proven to be worthy a lot on different hashing techniques and algorithms determining the overflow strategy, that allowed me to reason about their usage in different scenarios and places.  
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Programming Language Concepts (CENG242)" >}}
   Within this course, I was first introduced to core ideas of different programming paradigms.
   
   Especially the ideas behind [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) has amazed me since it was my first encounter with a language, that doesn't inherit C-style programming (even if one might argue some aspects of Python) or doesn't follow imperative (also object-oriented) mind set of thinking about code. Another aspect was the idea of pure functions (Monads or IO was out of the scope of the course) and the type system. I was familiar with the idea that using functions one can emulate the same process of a Turing machine according to Church-Turing hypothesis, however realizing there is a large ecosystem based on Church's ideas has also been an important revelation.
   
   I have also learned about the scope resolution of different OOP languages and different types of argument passing used in different languages. I have also learned about how C arrays have a weird quirk about whether they are a type or not in the language's type system and what lazy evaluation is.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Algorithms (CENG315)" >}}
   On the algorithms course I have learned about the details of various graph and string algorithms.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Computer Organization (CENG331)" >}}
   This course has been a very delightful one to learn, considering that it was the second step in understanding how computers function internally (after Logic Design). Starting from basic addition to details on CPU functionality and caches.
    
   The homeworks given for this course have been some of the many creative homeworks that I have seen in my academical career, reading a binary program to defuse a bomb, hacking a binary using buffer overflow and return oriented programming, optimizing matrix multiplication to use available caches and increase it's speed at least 4 times.   
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Data Management and File Structures (CENG351)" >}}
    This course was mainly about SQL databases work and how files are stored in various systems. I took this course after having a decent experience in SQL and fairly good knowledge on inodes and storage mechanisms of OS, since I already took Operating Systems class. However, in this course I have learned about storage of block data and how indexes built (with B+ Trees).
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Introduction to Operating Systems (CENG334)" >}}
    As a sequel to CENG331, I have learned about mechanisms that operating systems use to execute programs in a secure and fast manner, while allocating resources to different programs executing in (pseudo-)parallel in a way that there is no deadlock.
    
   Also in this course I have learned about processes, threads and synchronization between those. This has contributed a better understanding to me about how locks and semaphores work. Furthermore I have enjoyed reading and solving the problems in Little Book of Semaphores, and the MINIX book by Andrew S. Tannenbaum afterwards (even though I never got to finish it).

{{< cv/collapse title="Extracurricular Activities" >}}

During my time at METU I took an active role in many different student societies and hosted some events regarding those. Some societies I have participated in:
{{< cv/collapse title="METU Young Entrepreneurs Society (METU YES)" >}}

{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="METU Computer Club (METU CCLUB)" >}}
Even though I didn't directly contribute to the club by attending to meetings, I have helped them develop their website with a better admin interface, and I have written some articles to their e-journal e-Bergi.

The articles that I wrote (in Turkish) during my undergrad studies can be found [here](https://e-bergi.com/yazar/ozan-incesulu/).
