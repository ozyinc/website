{{< cv/collapse title="Courses" isFirst="1">}}

I took many courses during my studies in the METU CENG department from basic CS courses to Spanish and Psychology, and listing all here would be unnecessary. However, some highlights that made me a better developer are: 

{{< cv/collapse title="Introduction to Computer Engineering Concepts (CENG111)" >}}
   This introductory course was the first course among many that I took during my studies that introduced me to the fundamentals of computer science and engineering. During this course I have learned: 
   * fundamental functionality of a basic CPU, which was astonishing on how it reflects the general functionalities and issues regarding computer programming (mainly robustness and step-by-step execution of programs).
   * basics of recursion and iteration, and how to map one to other, considering the implications that this has for dynamic programming and many other algorithms I would personally consider this the best contribution.
   * basics of complexity analysis
   * Ubuntu, Linux and the GNU ecosystem
   * and Python :grinning:   

{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="C Programming (CENG140)" >}}
   As the second course about CENG that I took, this course has introduced me to the C language and it's low-level complex beauty. While learning how to write efficient code and managing dynamic memory, our instructor has also introduced us to how the memory in a computer is managed and what parts do programs have, answering many questions that I had while learning Python. Even though most of the topics were merely an introduction to the concepts and ideas of the programming languages and operating systems courses in the future, it has succeeded in creating an overall idea and appreciation of the hardships of the field that our predecessors have faced regarding basic optimization.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Logic Design (CENG232)" >}}
   I took this course in my first year, and it provided a better understanding of the actual implementation of various parts of the computer, starting with a few logic gates and adding clocks to provide sequential execution. With this course I have learned how specific mechanisms needed for a computer's functionality can be realized, and it also introduced me to FPGA programming using Verilog.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Data Structures (CENG213)" >}}
   This course, even if it has covered many basic data structures (like stacks, queues, linked list, trees, arrays, etc...), has a special place in my memory, due to its detailed insights on workings of hash tables.With this course I learned a lot of different hashing techniques and algorithms determining the overflow strategy, that allowed me to reason about their usage in different scenarios and places.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Programming Language Concepts (CENG242)" >}}
   Within this course, I was first introduced to core ideas of different programming paradigms.
   
   Especially the ideas behind [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) have amazed me since it was my first encounter with a language that doesn't inherit C-style programming (even if one might argue some aspects of Python) or doesn't follow an imperative (also object-oriented) mind set of thinking about code. Another aspect was the idea of pure functions (Monads or IO was out of the scope of the course) and the type system. I was familiar with the idea that using functions one can emulate the same process of a Turing machine according to the Church-Turing hypothesis, however realizing there is a large ecosystem based on Church's ideas has also been an important revelation.
   
   I have also learned about the scope resolution of different OOP languages and different types of argument passing used in different languages. I have also learned about how C arrays have a weird quirk about whether they are a type or not in the language's type system and what lazy evaluation is.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Algorithms (CENG315)" >}}
   On the algorithms course I have learned about the details of various graph and string algorithms.
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Computer Organization (CENG331)" >}}
   This course has been a very delightful one to learn, considering that it was the second step in understanding how computers function internally (after Logic Design). Starting from basic addition to details on CPU functionality and caches.
    
   The homework given for this course have featured some of many creative tasks that I have seen in my academic career, reading a binary program to defuse a bomb, hacking a binary using buffer overflow and return oriented programming, optimizing matrix multiplication to use available caches and increase its speed at least 4 times.   
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Data Management and File Structures (CENG351)" >}}
    This course was mainly about SQL databases work and how files are stored in various systems. I took this course after having a decent experience in SQL and fairly good knowledge on inodes and storage mechanisms of OS, since I already took Operating Systems class. However, in this course I have learned about storage of block data and how indexes built (with B+ Trees).
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Introduction to Operating Systems (CENG334)" >}}
    As a sequel to CENG331, I have learned about mechanisms that operating systems use to execute programs in a secure and fast manner, while allocating resources to different programs executing in (pseudo-)parallel in a way that there is no deadlock.
    
   Also in this course I have learned about processes, threads and synchronization between those. This has contributed a better understanding to me about how locks and semaphores work. Furthermore, I have enjoyed reading and solving the problems in Little Book of Semaphores, and the MINIX book by Andrew S. Tannenbaum afterwards (even though I never got to finish it).
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Data Communications and Networking (CENG435)" >}}

   Before taking this course I had fairly good knowledge about different high-level protocols, like HTTP(S), FTP, SSH, Telnet, etc. and a faint idea on how the internal mechanisms worked. During this course I had the opportunity to learn how each networking layer functions, various different protocols and their efficiencies. As a Computer Engineering course, the course had some details on how the low-level signal is transmitted from the cable but obviously we didn't dive deep into the specifics of the physics (I was told that Electronic Engineers have a more comprehensive course on that). 
   
   With this course, I was able to understand the current implementations of some widely used protocols like TCP, UDP, IP, DHCP. The understanding allowed me to better evaluate current technologies we have, have a better understanding of networking components of cloud systems and their security and decreased the entry barrier for understanding new standards of protocols like HTTP/3.
 
{{< /cv/collapse >}}
{{< cv/collapse title="Computer Engineering Design (CENG491-CENG492)" >}}
   
   This course (also known as the graduation project) has allowed me to use the things that I have learned by myself and during my internship at Stylelounge to create a product with a team of fellow senior students. The main aim of the course was not to deliver a production-ready app but just to create an MVP to showcase the product. For the details of the project you may visit the project's page [here](https://senior.ceng.metu.edu.tr/2019/cow/).
   
   With this course I had my first challenge on being part of a team and discussing architectural choices for a greenfield project for the first time. I have built greenfield projects before in my life (especially for METU YES and Stylelounge) but the scope was limited to a few components, and the team size of those projects were 1 (myself) with occasional discussions with my fellow engineers and my supervisor.

{{< /cv/collapse >}}

{{< cv/collapse title="Introduction to Machine Learning (CENG499)" >}}
   With this course I was formally introduced with ML, the basic principles and many different algorithms with a special interest in Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models and Neural Networks. I believe that this course has provided me the insight for understanding and applying different mechanisms to further advance myself deep into other algorithms and advanced methodologies.
   
   Within this course I was asked to implement decision trees using different entropy functions, pre-pruning and post-pruning methodologies; neural networks using different error functions and layouts; support vector machines with different kernels and cross validation methods.
   
   I also had the opportunity to be a part of a team of 4 to tackle a real life problem that we chose. We chose to build a news article classifier after observing how many misclassifications Turkish newspaper networks have for their articles. We created a recurrent neural network using vectorization of words in the article as input, which performed better than manually selected labels provided by 2 different sources of Turkish articles.

{{< cv/collapse title="Extracurricular Activities" >}}

During my time at METU I took an active role in many student societies and hosted some events regarding those. Some societies I have participated in:

{{< cv/collapse title="METU Young Entrepreneurs Society (METU YES)" >}}
I was a member of the society for 3 years, of which I was the IT coordinator for 1.5 years. During my time I took responsibility for organizing many events (like Crystal Tree Awarding Ceremony, Entrepreneurship and Engineering Summit and NASA Space Apps Challenge) and interviews and maintained and improved the infrastructure needs of the society. 

During my time in the society I got to know many people from my university and from the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey. Furthermore, I have gained experience in creating and developing web solutions and learned from my mistakes (including accidentally wiping an SQL database with a wrong query on production :sweat_smile: ). I have further described my experience with those here: {{< todo >}}
 
{{< /cv/collapse >}}

{{< cv/collapse title="METU Computer Club (METU CCLUB)" >}}
Even though I didn't directly contribute to the club by attending the meetings, I have helped them develop their website with a better admin interface, and I have written some articles to their e-journal e-Bergi.

The articles that I wrote (in Turkish) during my undergraduate studies can be found [here](https://e-bergi.com/yazar/ozan-incesulu/).

{{% cv/section title="Miscellaneous"%}}
The topics that interest me professionally are system architecture design, DevOps, machine learning, data analytics and scripting languages.

Apart from the professional life; I am currently learning neuroscience and philosophy (Nietzsche is my favorite), I enjoy watching documentaries and sitcoms (mostly through Netflix), I listen to podcasts over Spotify (I would recommend Command Line Heroes and The Economist Radio) I play tennis and go skiing whenever I find the time for it. 

My native language is Turkish, I am proficient in English (TOEFL: 113/120), I know Spanish enough to understand the language (B1), and I have a basic knowledge of German (A1) and Italian (A1).

I enjoy coding in Python, have a love/hate relationship with Javascript, however enjoy coding in Elm whenever I can. Think that I'm also fairly good at C, SQL and Java. I am interested in learning different programming languages, and would be fairly excited about any job opportunities if they were to include Rust, Go or C# other than previously mentioned languages. 
{{%cv/detail%}}
I have also completed courses regarding robotics and learning from Coursera and edX.
